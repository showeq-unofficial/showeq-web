// Coordinate-convention helpers shared by every UI surface that prints
// a position number.
//
// The daemon ships positions in SCREEN convention (+X = East/right,
// +Y = South/down) — X and Y are negated from EQ's RUNTIME convention
// (+X = West, +Y = North) at proto-serialization time (see
// showeq-daemon/src/protoencoder.cpp fillPos). The map renders directly
// in screen convention, so dot/line/grid geometry is correct as-is.
//
// EQ's in-game `/loc` command, however, prints (Y, X, Z) in runtime
// convention. Any coordinate the user reads and compares to `/loc` must
// be flipped back — otherwise the number looks negated/backwards even
// though the point on the map is right. Route ALL user-facing coordinate
// text through these helpers so the tooltip, the status bar, and the map
// grid labels all agree with in-game `/loc`.
